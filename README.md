# travel-site
This is a site that I created using a walkthrough. It taught me a lot about good ways of automating my development workflow like browser refreshes, keeping things synced, clean and organized.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Finished Product</th>
    <th>Automated tools</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>app/index.html</td>
    <td>gulp/tasks</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
